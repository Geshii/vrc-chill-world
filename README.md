# VRChat Ramen Club world \☕
                       
A VRChat comfy world, Quest optimized. Good for chilling, watching videos and more.       
This World was first based on the Spooky Ghost's chill room, and was optimised, and I added a lot of content.              
                 
## Setup/Installation \:gear:
           
**If you want to setup your own version of this map, here are the steps :**          
      
__1 •__ Open a blank 3D project in **Unity 2018.4.20f1** (very important ! see [VRC SDK](https://docs.vrchat.com/docs/setting-up-the-sdk) for more info.).             
__2 •__ Import the [**VRChat SDK 2.0**](https://vrchat.com/home/download), then close the project.            
__3 •__ Replace all the files with this project in your Unity project's folder            
__4 •__ Open the project, and there you go ! The scene is named __chill hangout dope rain room x2.unity__             
__4 •__ Then, to publish, you have 2 choices                  
        :arrow_right: **1 :** If you have enough "trust" into VRChat, you can publish it to the Community Labs                
        :arrow_right: **2 :** If not, you can publish it privately, so you and your friends can join it                
### :bulb:**Please take note to add a star if you use it, to support me, and to mention me if you want !**
