Hello! Thanks for downloading me VRChat pens!
They use the SnailMarker shaders that you see on many avatars,
but have been optimized to be used in your world, and you're free to use
and modify these to your heart's content.

Everything should work perfectly fine by just importing the prefabs,
though if you're importing the Desk with the respawn button, you must have
your SceneDescriptor to Respawn objects when they fall out of the world.

*Note, if pressing the Respawn button does nothing, then Unity decided to
whipe what object it's teleporting to. Simply go into the Respawn button
object and place the Respawn object inside the target on the trigger.

If you have any questions, just message me on Discord!
